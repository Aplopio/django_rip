    This class defines the interface of how an authorization class
    must be written. All the functions should take a apiv2 request
    as input. Each function must add to the request object and return
    if successful. If authorization fails, then return a response
    with is_success as false and a reason code. It is recommended that you
    use authorization failed reason code. By default all actions are permitted
